### Project Overview
The system helps relief organizations or local governments streamline disaster response by managing volunteer efforts, keeping track of resources like food and medical supplies, and monitoring the speed and efficiency of disaster response. ResQnect is a comprehensive disaster response management system designed to assist communities in preparation, response, and recovery during emergencies. This project aligns with **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** by providing organized resources and volunteer management to enhance disaster response capabilities. 

### Application of Python Concepts
In developing ResQnect, several Python concepts and libraries were applied to achieve efficient and scalable performance, including:
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** for a modular and maintainable structure.
- **Error Handling** to ensure program reliability during real-world usage.
- [Additional libraries or Python features relevant to the project, if any.]
